Simple, lightweight pack with Create, Mekanism, some additions for both, and AE2. Terrain generation is from Terralith, Nullscape, and Incendium.

The difficulty gets harder the longer you play and the more things you do. Visiting the Nether and killing the Ender Dragon will both increase difficulty levels. Currently no custom recipes, but they will be added to make some recipes harder and some easier.
